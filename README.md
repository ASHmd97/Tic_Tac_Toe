# Tic_Tac_Toe

This code represents the "Tic-Tac-Toe" game between a player and the computer using the Tkinter graphical user interface in Python. The game utilizes a 3x3 board, and players aim to place either an "X" or an "O" symbol in the board cells such that they have three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Key features of the code include:

The ability to restart the game.
Displaying game results between the player and the computer.
Determining the winner or a tie.
Updating game results on the graphical user interface.
The code also includes an addition to simulate the computer's move in the game, where a randomly selected empty cell represents the computer's "O" move. The game checks for a win or a tie after each move and updates the user interface accordingly.
